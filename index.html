    What Is Self-Improvement?
 </h2>
  <p>
    From the time we’re born, our brains are constantly absorbing new information. We become better at using our words and more adept with using our bodies. To improve our minds, as kids and young adults, we commit most of our lives to learning in school. But our journey of learning doesn’t have to end when school ends. Learning how to make ourselves better, kinder, people is a lifelong effort. It involves also un-learning some of the harmful or negative beliefs we may have been exposed to. <span> That’s what personal development and self-improvement is all about. </span>

      My Backstory
  </h3>
    <p id=backstory>
      My name is Ebony Hargro. When I was younger and I’d run out of books to read, I’d go into my dad’s book collection and read his. My dad was really into self-help books and, though they were well beyond my reading level at the time, I’d try to understand them. I would highlight any words I didn’t know and look them up in the dictionary, and I really enjoyed the feeling of pushing myself to grow by expanding my vocabulary. Those books introduced me to self-improvement concepts such as <span>  healthy habits, discipline, self-love, and accountability at an early age. I've been passionate about prioritizing my emotional and mental wellbeing, and have created Self Improvement for Beginners to connect people to resources that can support them at all phases of their wellness journey. </span>
